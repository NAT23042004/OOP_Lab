Question:
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer:
No. Because Method Overloading in Java  allow different methods have the same name but different signatures where the signature can differ by the number of input parameters or type of input parameters, or a mixture of both.
The scenario above will make JAVA confused whether the way you want to build a DVD since both methods have the same number of parameter and type of title and category are String.
